    <h2>Fair or Foul</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The position of the ball</span> is the deciding factor in the ‘fair’ or ‘foul’ call, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not the
position of the fielder</span>. Any part of the line and the base is considered fair territory.
There are three main cases to consider: balls on the infield, balls in the outfield, and
balls that bounce over a base.</p>

    <p>A fair ball must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Settle in fair territory between 1st and 3rd bases, or</p></li>
      <li><p>Bounce past 3rd or 1st base in fair territory, or</p></li>
      <li><p>Bounce over first or third base, or</p></li>
      <li><p>Fall fair beyond 1st or 3rd base on a fly ball, or</p></li>
      <li><p>Be first touched on or over fair territory.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fair territory</span> is the area within foul lines. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foul territory</span> is the area outside the
  foul lines. The line is considered in fair territory so the entire ball must be outside the
  lines to be foul.</p>
    <p>Note: If a fielder is standing in foul territory and touches the ball whilst over fair
  territory, it is a fair ball. Likewise, if a fielder is standing in fair territory and touches
  the ball over foul territory, it is a foul ball.</p>
    <h3>Other rules relating to foul balls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>On a foul, the ball is usually dead. Runners may not advance and cannot be put
out.</p></li>
      <li><p>However, if a foul ball is caught, the batter is out and the ball is alive. Runners can
advance and can be put out.</p></li>
      <li><p>A foul ball is a strike when the batter has less than two strikes</p></li>
      <li><p>Once there are two strikes on the batter, a foul ball is not a strike</p></li>
    </ul>

          <h3>Fair ball signal</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>A fair ball should be signalled when the ball lands, or is
first touched within a metre of the foul lines</p></li>
            <li><p>'Fair ball' is signalled by extending your arm straight out
from the shoulder and horizontal to the ground toward
the infield</p></li>

          <ul>
            <li><p>A foul ball is a legally batted ball that settles in foul
territory between home and 1st base or between home
and 3rd base, bounds past 1st or 3rd base in foul territory,
or first touches foul territory beyond 1st or 3rd base</p></li>
