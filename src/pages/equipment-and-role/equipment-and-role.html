      <h2>Equipment and Role</h2>
      <p>Plate umpires stand behind the catcher, call balls and strikes, and control many aspects
    of the game. They need to wear protective equipment, including</p>
      <ion-grid>
        <ion-row>
          <ion-col>
            <ul>
              <li>a face mask</li>
              <li>a chest protector</li>
              <li>leg guards</li>
              <li>suitable footwear</li>

      <p>Base umpires start near the bases, and are responsible for making safe and out calls at
  the bases. They also need appropriate footwear.</p>
      <p>All umpires should carry a ball/strike/out counter ("clicker"), which they operate with
  their left hand.</p>
      <h3>Beginner umpire</h3>
      <p>Beginner umpires often worry about technical rules such as interference or obstruction.
While these are important elements of the game, it is important to stress that beginners
are not expected to know all the rules immediately. Rule knowledge builds naturally
over time, but starts with these basic decisions.</p>
      <h3>Signals</h3>
      <p>There are two types of signals that an umpire will use. One set is used to communicate
to the players, coaches, scorers and spectators the decisions made during the game, e.g.
safe and out, fair and foul.</p>
      <p>The other set of signals is used to communicate between the umpires, e.g. the number
of outs. Following are a few of the more common signals that you may be required to
use while umpiring.</p>
      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>The most common decisions that an umpire must make are:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Ball or Strike — Safe or Out — Fair or Foul</p>
