    <p>Just before the game starts, a plate meeting is held between the umpires and the
coaches of both teams.</p>
    <p>The plate umpire stands behind home plate, the base umpire stands in front of the
plate, and the coaches stand to the sides, on the same side as the dugout that their
team is occupying.</p>
    <p>The plate meeting provides the opportunity to make introductions, to clarify any
special rules or game conditions, and to confirm team line-ups.</p>
