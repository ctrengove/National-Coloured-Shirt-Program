    <h2>The Two Umpire System</h2>
    <p>Beginning umpires commonly start out as a base umpire working with a plate umpire in
the Two Umpire System. This System divides responsibility for various decisions between
the two umpires.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The plate umpire calls balls and strikes, safes and outs, fair and foul and plays at 3rd
base and home</p></li>
      <li><p>The base umpire calls safes and outs on plays at 1st and 2nd base</p></li>
      <li><p>Both umpires must watch runners touch bases and base runners tagging up on fly ball</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> The Two Umpire System requires umpires to move into positions appropriate for
each play.</p>
    <h3>Base umpire positioning and movement</h3>
    <p>The starting position for the base umpire when there are no runners on base is in foul
territory about 6 or 7 metres beyond 1st base.</p>
    <p>With a runner on 1st, the starting position for the base umpire is half to two-thirds of
the distance between 1st and 2nd base.</p>
    <p>With runners on 2nd or 3rd, the base umpire starts approximately halfway between 2nd
and 3rd bases.</p>

            <li><p>For an infield play, the umpire moves
into fair territory and obtains an angle
on the play</p></li>
            <li><p>For an outfield hit, the umpire moves
into the diamond, keeping the ball and
the play in front of you</p></li>
