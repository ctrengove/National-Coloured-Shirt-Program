    <h2>The Infield Fly</h2>
    <p>An infield fly is a fair fly ball (not including a line drive, or an attempted bunt), which
can be easily caught by an infielder.</p>
    <p>It is called only when 1st and 2nd, or 1st, 2nd and 3rd bases are occupied with less than two
outs.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the infield fly rule is to protect the batting team, as otherwise there is a
possibility that a double or triple play can be executed if the ball is allowed to fall to
the ground.</p>

            <li><p>The plate umpire calls the infield fly.</p></li>
            <li><p>By the time the ball has reached the top of its
arc, and is determined by the plate umpire to be
an infield fly, the umpire should raise their right
arm in the air and call 'infield fly – batter is out'.
The umpire must then signal 'out'</p></li>
            <li><p>If the ball is close to the foul line and it is
difficult to determine whether the ball is going
to be fair or foul, the plate umpire will call
"infield fly – batter is out if fair". If the ball is
fair, the plate umpire will follow the protocol
outlined above; if the ball is foul, the plate
umpire will then signal 'foul ball'</p></li>
