    <h2>The Safe Signal</h2>
    <p>A safe signal is required to indicate that a play made at a base has not been successful
in putting out a base runner, perhaps because the base runner beat the throw, or a tag
was missed or not in time.</p>
    <p>Don't make the call too soon!</p>

    <p>To perform the safe signal</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>With your head straight forward looking at the play, come up to a standing
position</p></li>
      <li>Bring both hands up to your chest about shoulder height</li>
      <li>Give a verbal call of ‘safe’, while fully extending your arms horizontally, parallel
with the ground and your palms down</li>
      <li>Adopt a relaxed standing position while keeping your eyes open for any further
plays</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> This procedure enables you to hold your view and focus on the play until all
action has been completed. Moving too early or not staying stationary during the play
can lead to incorrect decisions.</p>
