    <h2>Three Basic Principles</h2>
    <h3>The division principle</h3>
    <p>The home plate umpire takes all calls at home plate and 3rd base and the base umpire
takes all calls at 1st and 2nd bases. There are four exceptions:</p>

          <ul class="list-container">
            <li><p>When the batter-runner goes to 3rd base, the
base umpire goes with them to make the call
at 3rd</p></li>
            <li><p>On infield plays, the base umpire takes the first
call on a base, even if it is at 3rd base</p></li>
          </ul>
        </ion-col>
      </ion-row>
    </ion-grid>
    <ul style="margin-top: -20px;">
      <li><p>When a runner steals to 3rd base, the base
umpire takes the call</p></li>
      <li><p>When the base umpire is positioned between
2nd and 3rd bases and there is an attempted
pick-off by the catcher to 1st base, the plate
umpire takes the call</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The infield/outfield principle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>When the ball is in the infield, the base umpire moves or stays in the outfield</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The leading runner principle</h3>
    <p>This principle dictates that the base umpire should start in a position that is up with the
leading base runner.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>With a base runner at 1st base (only), the base umpire will start between 1st and 2nd
bases</p></li>
      <li><p>With a base runner at 2nd base, the base umpire will start between 2nd and 3rd bases</p></li>
      <li style="list-style: none;"><p>Note: This allows the base umpire to make calls at the base the leading base
  runner is advancing to. Also, on a pick-off play, the catcher is more likely to make
  a play on the leading base runner and the base umpire needs to be in a position to
  make this call.</p></li>
