          <h3>Indicating the outs</h3>
          <p>During the game, the plate and base umpires confirm the
number of outs to each other after each batter.</p>
          <p>This is done by extending the corresponding number of fingers
downwards against the trouser leg.</p>
          <p>The plate umpire indicates the number of outs first, and then
the base umpire responds.</p>

          <h3>Potential infield fly</h3>
          <p>When there are runners on 1st and 2nd, or 1st, 2nd and 3rd with less
than two out, there is potential for an infield fly to be called.</p>
          <p>The plate and base umpire confirm this to each other by placing
the right arm across the chest while indicating the number of
outs (zero or one).</p>

          <h3>Requesting the count</h3>
          <p>When the plate umpire is uncertain of the count,
they should consult the base umpire by placing
two fists (left hand first) against the chest in the
direction of the base umpire.</p>
          <p>In return, the base umpire will indicate the count
(left hand first) against their chest so it is clearly
visible to the plate umpire. This may also be
verbalised.</p>
